# manager-situations
A ruby CLI filled with challenging questions about how to handle common and not-so-common manager scenarios


## Adding New Scenarios

If you have a managing scenario to add, please edit the `scenarios.txt` file, appending the last line with what you want to add (one scenario per line, please!)

## Running manager-situations

From the command line, run `incoming-scenario.rb` to receive a new scenario. You and your managering pairing partner will talk about what you would do immediately in the situation, then go over the company-specific, legal, and moral implications of the scenario.
